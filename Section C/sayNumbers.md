Analysis of the worst-case space complexity of the sayNumber code

A method called sayNumber in the sayNumber code converts an integer to its string representation in English. The maximum quantity of memory the function can take up when processing the largest input is referred 
to as the worst-case space complexity of the sayNumber code. The way the sayNumber code operates is to divide the incoming integer into three-digit groups, 
beginning with the rightmost group, and translate each group into its English equivalent. The input number 123456789, for instance, 
would be divided into the three groups 123, 456 and 789, and each group would be translated into its English equivalent: "One hundred twenty-three," 
"Four hundred fifty-six," and "Seven hundred eighty-nine." The function would then combine the three groups' English depictions to produce the desired outcome: 
"One hundred twenty-three million four hundred fifty-six thousand seven hundred eighty-nine".

The worst-case space complexity of the sayNumber code can be analyzed by considering the memory usage of each step in the function.

1.The input number is transformed into a list of digits: The input integer must be represented by a list of digits in this stage. In the worst situation, the list's size would be O(log n), where n is the input integer, and n is the number of digits in the input integer.
2.The next stage is to group the digits into groups of three. To do this, you must create a list of lists, with each sublist containing three digits from the input list. In the worst situation, the number of sublists would be O(log n) because it depends on the input integer's digit count.
3.English representation of each group: To complete this stage, an English representation of each group of three digits must be represented by a string. In the worst case, the largest three-digit number ("nine hundred ninety-nine") has a fixed length, so even though the length of the string would rely on the value of the three digits, it is still constrained by a constant.
4.Concatenation of the English representations of the groups: To complete this stage, the English representations of the groups must be concatenated into a string. In the worst situation, the string would have a size that is O(log n) in proportion to the number of groups.

As a result, the sayNumber code's worst-case space complexity is O(log n), where n is the input number. This is due to the function's RAM requirements scaling logarithmically with input size.
