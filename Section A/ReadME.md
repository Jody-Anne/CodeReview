Java Code: Reversing a String and Fibonacci Series
This Java code demonstrates two different functions:

reverse_string: Reverses a given string using recursion
function: Generates and prints out the Fibonacci series up to a given number
Setup
Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download it from Oracle's website.
Download the Java code file recursion.java to a directory on your system.
Usage
Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the recursion.java file is saved.
Compile the code using the following command:
bash
Copy code
javac recursion.java
Run the code using the following command:
bash
Copy code
java recursion
The program will output the reversed string and the Fibonacci series of 10 numbers.
